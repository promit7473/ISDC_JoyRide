**Joy Ride - Project Overview**

This project provides an opportunity to develop code that controls a simulated car. It consists of three parts, with only the third part required for submission.

**Part One - Drag Race**
In this section, youâ€™ll create code that enables a car to leap over a grove of trees. While this scenario might be unusual for a self-driving car, it will help you get acquainted with the programming interface.

**Part Two - Circular Track**
Here, youâ€™ll write code to guide a car around a circular track. This part will help you understand the relationship between steering angles and turning radii.

**Part Three - Parallel Park**
In the final part, youâ€™ll develop a sequence of instructions to successfully parallel park a car.
